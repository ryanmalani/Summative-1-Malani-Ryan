## Summative 1 Assessment - Spring Boot and REST

In this assessment, you will build a simple REST web service. It will provide quote-of-the-day, word-of-the-day, and magic 8-ball services. In addition, you will produce a 1-3 minute video summary of the project. The requirements and features are detailed below. 

## Structure

Your solution must have the following structural elements:

- Your solution must be in an IntelliJ project called `Summative-1-Lastname-Firstname`.
- Your project must be built using Spring Boot and Spring MVC. Initialize your project using `start.spring.io`.
- Your project must have a series of tests using MockMvc.
- Your project must have an in-memory DAO that follows the pattern demonstrated previously in this module.
- Your REST API must accept and return data in JSON format where appropriate.
- Your REST API must be documented with Swagger. Save the `.yaml` file in the root of your project directory.


## Requirements and Features

  - URI: /word
  - Method: GET
  - Request Body: None
  - Response Body: Definition

- Definition Object instance variables:
  - id
  - word
  - definition

- Magic 8-ball API:
  - URI: /magic
  - Method: POST
  - Request Body: Question
  - Response Body: Answer

- Answer Object instance variables:
  - id
  - question
  - answer


### Additional Requirements

- Your service must contain at least 10 quotes. Quotes must be served up at random.
- Your service must contain at least 10 words and their corresponding definitions. Words and definitions must be served up at random.
- Your service must contain at least 6 different magic 8-ball responses. 8-ball answers must be served up at random.
    - The POST request for the magic 8-ball endpoint should include a user-provided question.
    > Note: The students are not being asked to provide Entity/Model validations or validation responses in this summative. This means that
    > it is possible to submit the magic 8-Ball POST request without a question and a response will still be returned.

## Video Summary Requirement

- Create a 1-3 minute video summary highlighting your project. Be sure to highlight the sections of the project that are important
in meeting the project requirements. Be sure to provide the following video requirements:
    * Video should be created in MP4 format.
    * Video should include a screen capture recording to display the important sections of the project.
